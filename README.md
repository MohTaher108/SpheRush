My second game I've ever created, which is a tower defense game. The aim is to prevent enemies from getting all the way to the end of their path by placing turrets that eliminate them.

If you'd like to install the game, here's a link to the installer file in my google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Afx6hLKp2hX9HGWGeIqar6Y2CAHP8zk/view?usp=sharing (don't worry about the virus warning, I promise I'm a good person :D)
Just download and run it and it'll open the installer script where you'll choose where to download the game, and you can add a desktop shortcut to open the game easily!
If you don't use the desktop shortcut, just open the directory where you installed the game (which is program files by default), and click the file with the tower icon.
